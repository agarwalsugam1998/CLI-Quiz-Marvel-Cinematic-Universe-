### Why?

I wanted to learn JavaScipt:

- To understand basic i/p & o/p in JS
- To write more complex projects
- To explore different libraries of JS
- To understand how a external user should interact with my program

### Libraries Used

---

- Read-Line Sync
- Chalk
- CLI-Table

### Installation

---

1. Open https://replit.com/~ to write JavaScript Code
   - `install npm-readline sync`
   - `install npm-chalk`
   - `install cli-table`

### Usage

---

To start the interactive program, simply click on the play button.

`marvel-cinematic-universe` was built with a thought that user should intervene less with the inputs. Idea is to provide seamless experience to end-user.

- Enter your name
- Look at the character-attainment table for the desired score
- Press "Y" to play
